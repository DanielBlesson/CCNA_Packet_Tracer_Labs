# Connecting Devices

# Abstract : 
Designing a network topology to connect devices using wired connections is a fundamental aspect of network engineering. This abstract explores the process of creating such connections using Cisco Packet Tracer, a simulation tool widely used in the networking industry. It delves into the selection of appropriate devices such as switches, routers, and end devices, and outlines the configuration steps required to establish wired connectivity.
