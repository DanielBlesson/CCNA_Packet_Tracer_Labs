# Abstract
OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model into its seven layers:

Physical Layer (Layer 1):
This layer deals with the physical connection between devices.
It defines the characteristics of the transmission medium, such as cables, connectors, and signaling.
It handles data transmission in the form of bits over the network.

Data Link Layer (Layer 2):
This layer provides error-free transmission of data frames between nodes over a physical network.
It handles addressing, framing, and error detection.
It also manages access to the physical medium, resolving issues like collisions in Ethernet networks.

Network Layer (Layer 3):
This layer focuses on routing and forwarding data packets between different networks.
It is responsible for logical addressing (IP addressing) and routing decisions based on network topology and addressing.
It ensures data delivery by determining the best path from the source to the destination.

Transport Layer (Layer 4):
This layer provides end-to-end communication between hosts and ensures data reliability, flow control, and error recovery.
It segments and reassembles data from upper-layer protocols into manageable units.
It offers connection-oriented (TCP) and connectionless (UDP) communication services.

Session Layer (Layer 5):
This layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between applications.
It handles session synchronization, checkpointing, and recovery.
It provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization of communicating peers.

Presentation Layer (Layer 6):
This layer deals with the syntax and semantics of data exchanged between systems.
It translates, encrypts, or compresses data into a format that can be understood by the application layer.
It handles data encryption/decryption, data compression, and data formatting.

Application Layer (Layer 7):
This layer interacts directly with end-user applications and provides network services to applications.
It includes protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS, etc., which enable communication between software applications.
It allows users to access network resources and perform tasks such as file transfers, email communication, and web browsing.
